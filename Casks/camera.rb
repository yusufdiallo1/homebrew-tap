  caveats <<~EOS
    Camera needs a few permissions, each asked for when it is first used:

      Camera and Microphone  capture
      Photos                 saving, add-only — it never reads your library
      Screen Recording       only for the Screen tab

    Screen Recording is read once at launch, so quit and reopen the app after
    granting it.
