  # Homebrew quarantines what it downloads, and because this app is not
  # notarized Gatekeeper then refuses to launch it — silently, with no dialog
  # and nothing in the log. Clearing the flag here is what makes the installed
  # app open on the first try rather than appearing to do nothing.
  #
  # `must_succeed: false` because a missing flag makes xattr exit non-zero,
  # and that is not a reason to fail an otherwise good install.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Camera needs a few permissions, each asked for when it is first used:

      Camera and Microphone  capture
      Photos                 saving, add-only — it never reads your library
      Screen Recording       only for the Screen tab

    Screen Recording is read once at launch, so quit and reopen the app after
    granting it.
